# DNN vNext ProtoType for .NET Core
DNN vNext is a prototyope project testing feasibility for creating a DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) version that runs on .NET Core. 

This is 1 piece of a 3 part solution
  1- Current web forms version of DNN
  2- Razor Pages module that runs in both versions
  3- This project... the .NET Core prototype

## Built for Testing Feasibility
vNext was designed for testing the feasibility of a DNN version running on .NET Core. Having a version of DNN that runs on .NET Core allows the application to run across platforms i.e. it would run on a Mac, Linux, etc. 

## Migration Path
The purpose of the Razor Pages module (#2 project) that runs on the current web forms version of DNN is to create a module type that will serve as a potential transition path or bridge from the current version to the next (.NET Core version - this project). Having a medium that works in both contexts will greatly serve the DNN ecosystem by reducing the amount of "breaking changes" associated with a migration to the new platform.

## Limitations
As this project is a prototype testing feasibility there is no feature parity between this prototype and the current web forms version of DNN.

## Setup
